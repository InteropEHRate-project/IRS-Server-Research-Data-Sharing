# InteropEHRate IRS Server Research Data Sharing


This repository stores the two components relative to the InteropEHRate Research Protocol server side.

The Central Node web portal, and the Research Centre (RC) application.

## Central Node

The Central Node web portal component, stored in "RDS/central node/login-upload/", is developed in NodeJS.

It requires a previous set up of a postgresql database, which needs to be initialized with the sql file "RDS/central-node/psql-db/central-node.sql".

For PostgreSQL documentation refer to https://www.postgresql.org/docs/
